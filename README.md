Time Travel Betting Markets
Project Description
Time Travel Betting Markets is an innovative decentralized prediction market platform that combines the excitement of betting with blockchain's immutable time-stamping capabilities. Users can create and participate in prediction markets about future events, with unique "time capture" mechanics that permanently record the state of resolution moments on the blockchain.
The platform leverages smart contracts to ensure transparent, trustless betting where outcomes are resolved fairly and winnings are distributed automatically. Each market resolution captures a snapshot of blockchain state (timestamp, block number, block hash) creating an immutable historical record of when and how predictions were settled.
Project Vision
Our vision is to create the most transparent and innovative prediction market platform in the Web3 space, where users can:

Predict the Future: Bet on real-world events with confidence in fair resolution
Capture Time: Create permanent, immutable records of prediction outcomes
Earn Rewards: Generate returns by making accurate predictions about future events
Build Trust: Participate in a completely transparent, blockchain-based betting ecosystem

We envision a future where prediction markets serve not just as entertainment, but as valuable tools for information aggregation, risk assessment, and historical documentation of important events.
